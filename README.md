# Cloud Computing Concepts

*What is Cloud?*

The cloud is something present in a remote location. Cloud provides services over public and private networks such as VPN, LAN etc.

*What is Cloud Computing?*

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computer services which includes storage, databases, servers, networking, software, analytics and intelligence over the internet. It refers to manipulating, configuring and accessing the hardware and software resources remotely.

Since cloud computing provides platform independency it makes our applications collaborative and mobile.


## Basic Concepts

Certain services and concepts are at work behind the scenes to make cloud computing practical and available to end users. Following are 2 such models,

- Deployment models
- Service models


## Deployment models
Deployment model defines the type of access to the cloud. Cloud has 4 types of deployment models namely,

*Public Cloud*
- Public clouds are available to the general public, in which the data is created and stored on third-party servers.
*Private Cloud*
- Only one specific company owns a private cloud hence it is also called an internal or corporate model.
*Community Cloud*
- Community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations.
*Hybrid Cloud*
- A hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of public, private and community deployment models. Critical activities are performed using the private cloud while non critical activities are performed using the public cloud.




## Service Models

Cloud computing is a model for delivering IT services over the internet, enabling businesses to access and use a range of computing resources without having to own, manage, and maintain their own infrastructure. Cloud computing offers a range of service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), each with its own advantages and usages.

*Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):*
- IaaS provides a complete computing infrastructure, including virtualized servers, storage, and networking. With IaaS, organizations can quickly provision and manage their infrastructure without having to worry about the physical hardware. This model is suitable for organizations that require more control over their infrastructure and want to configure and manage their own virtual machines (VMs).

- Advantages:
- Flexibility: IaaS allows organizations to quickly and easily scale their computing resources up or down as needed.
- Scalability: IaaS providers offer a range of computing resources, including storage, processing power, and memory, which can be scaled up or down to meet changing business needs.
- Cost-effectiveness: With IaaS, organizations only pay for the resources they use, enabling them to reduce costs and avoid upfront capital expenses.
- Control: IaaS provides organizations with more control over their infrastructure, enabling them to configure and manage their own virtual machines.

- Usages:
- Hosting websites: IaaS can be used to host websites and web applications, providing organizations with the computing resources needed to deliver fast and reliable web experiences.
- Running applications: IaaS can be used to run applications, providing developers with the flexibility and control needed to build and deploy applications.
- Development and testing environments: IaaS can be used to create development and testing environments, providing developers with the resources they need to build and test new applications.
- Disaster recovery: IaaS can be used to create disaster recovery environments, enabling organizations to quickly recover from disasters and minimize downtime.

*Platform as a Service (PaaS):*
- PaaS provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider manages the servers, storage, and networking components of the infrastructure, while developers focus on writing and deploying applications. This model is suitable for developers who want to focus on application development and not worry about infrastructure management.

- Advantages:
- Rapid development and deployment: PaaS allows developers to quickly build and deploy applications without having to worry about infrastructure management.
- Reduced management and maintenance: PaaS providers manage the infrastructure and handle maintenance and updates, reducing the burden on developers and IT teams.
- Automatic scaling: PaaS providers automatically scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring that applications are always available and responsive.
- Cost-effective: PaaS allows organizations to reduce costs by eliminating the need to purchase and maintain hardware and software.

- Usages:
- Developing and deploying web applications: PaaS can be used to build and deploy web applications, providing developers with a platform for building and deploying web applications quickly and easily.
- Mobile applications: PaaS can be used to develop and deploy mobile applications, providing developers with a platform for building and deploying mobile applications.
- APIs: PaaS can be used to create and manage APIs, enabling organizations to easily expose their data and services to external developers and partners.
- Analytics: PaaS can be used to build and deploy analytics applications, providing organizations with the tools they need to analyze and gain insights from their data.

*Software as a Service (SaaS):*
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud service model that provides customers with access to software applications over the internet. SaaS providers host the software applications and make them available to customers on a subscription basis, typically charging a monthly or annual fee. With SaaS, customers do not need to install or maintain software applications on their own devices, as everything is accessed and managed through the cloud.

- Advantages:

- Easy accessibility: SaaS applications are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easy for users to access their software applications from any device.
- Automatic updates: SaaS providers handle software updates, ensuring that users always have access to the latest version of the software.
- Scalability: SaaS applications can be easily scaled up or down based on the number of users, making it a great option for businesses with fluctuating software requirements.
- Cost-effective: SaaS is often a cost-effective option, as it eliminates the need for businesses to purchase and maintain software licenses and hardware infrastructure.
- Usages:
- Productivity applications: SaaS productivity applications, such as email, calendar, and collaboration tools, can help businesses streamline their workflow and increase efficiency.
- Customer relationship management (CRM): SaaS CRM applications can help businesses manage their customer interactions and relationships, including tracking customer communications and managing customer data.
- Accounting and financial applications: SaaS accounting and financial applications can help businesses manage their finances, including invoicing, billing, and financial reporting.
- Human resources applications: SaaS human resources applications can help businesses manage their employee data, including tracking employee performance, managing payroll, and handling benefits administration.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing has numerous advantages.

- It is not required to install a software to access or manipulate cloud applications.
- Can manipulate and configure the applications online at any time.
- Facilitates the access of applications as utilities over the internet.
- Cost effective due to high efficiency with optimum utilization.
- Cloud computing provides online programming runtime environments and development and deployment tools through the Platform-as-a-service model.
- Cloud computing provides on-demand self-service. Resources can be used without interacting with the cloud service provider.
- Cloud computing offers load balancing.
- Risks of Cloud Computing
- Just like there are numerous advantages there are a few risks that comes along with cloud computing.

## Security and Privacy concerns
- Since infrastructure and data management is handled by a 3rd party it is a risk to give sensitive information to the cloud service providers.
- Lock in
- It is difficult to switch from one Cloud Service Provider to another. Due to this there is a high dependency on a particular Cloud Service Provider for service.
- Management interface compromise
- Customer management interfaces are accessible through the internet in the case of public cloud providers.
- Isolation failure
- Complications arise when multiple resources start using the shared resources at the same time. This can create isolation failure in which one organization’s data or resources will have access to other organization’s data and resources and vice versa.
